  <h1>Senior Project Fall 2022 </h1>
  <h4>Created by Elijah Love & Latrell Thomas</h4>
  <br/>
  <p>The Eye of Horus was used as a sign of prosperity and protection, derived from the myth of Isis and Osiris.</p>

<p>The Eye of Horus is an application help combat the issue of missing persons of color by providing a software that will be able to allow not only loved ones but also security agencies to identify users based of images. The Eye provides users with a prompt on
    how to upload images to scan. During the scanning process, our algorithm will check to see if a user is an
    existing member or not. If so, the user will be provided his or her information back to them
    and will further continue the process of creating an account with us. <br/><br/>
    Our goal is to provide hope when it seems like none is left.
