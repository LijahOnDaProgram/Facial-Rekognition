  <h1>Senior Project Fall 2022 </h1>
  <h4>Created by Elijah Love & Latrell Thomas</h4>
  <br/>
  <p>The Eye of Horus was used as a sign of prosperity and protection, derived from the myth of Isis and Osiris.</p>

<p>Our goal is to combat racial bias in facial recognition algorithms for people of color while being able
    to help protect and locate missing women and children of color. The Eye provides users with a prompt on
    how to upload images to scan. During the scanning process, our algorithm will check to see if a user is an
    existing member or not. If so, the user will be provided his or her information back to them
    and will further continue the process of creating an account with us.
